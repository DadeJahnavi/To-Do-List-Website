# ✅ To-Do List with Local Storage

A clean, responsive to-do list web app that helps you stay organized with ease. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it lets users add, complete, delete, filter, and reorder tasks — and stores everything in your browser using **Local Storage**, so nothing gets lost after a refresh.

## 🌟 Features
 - Bold modern color theme (with dark/light mode toggle)
 - Add, complete ✅, and delete 🗑️ tasks
 - Filter view: All / Completed / Incomplete
 - Drag-and-drop reorder
 - Saves tasks even after refresh
 - Fully responsive — works great on phones too!

## 🧠 What It Does
 - Adds tasks using a form (with validation)
 - Stores all tasks in browser using `localStorage`
 - Lets users toggle between completed/incomplete
 - Allows drag-and-drop reordering of tasks
 - Provides a light/dark mode toggle (saved between sessions)
